# Weekly Calendar

A modern, interactive weekly calendar application built with React, TypeScript, and Redux Toolkit. This application allows users to manage events with different recurrence patterns, drag-and-drop functionality, and a clean, intuitive interface.

## Features

- ðŸ“… Weekly calendar view with drag-and-drop event management
- ðŸ”„ Support for recurring events (daily and weekly patterns)
- ðŸŽ¨ Event categorization (Work, Personal, Meeting)
- ðŸŽ¯ Interactive event creation and editing
- ðŸ“± Responsive design
- ðŸŽ¨ Modern UI with Ant Design components

## Recurrence Logic

The calendar supports three types of event recurrence patterns:

1. **None (One-time events)**

   - Events that occur only once
   - Can be freely dragged and dropped to new times/dates

2. **Daily Recurrence**

   - Events that repeat every day
   - Starts from the event's creation date
   - Continues indefinitely within the calendar view

3. **Weekly Recurrence**
   - Events that repeat on specific days of the week
   - Users can select multiple days (e.g., Monday and Wednesday)
   - Maintains the same time slot across selected days
   - Starts from the event's creation date

### Implementation Details

- Recurrence patterns are stored in the event object with the following structure:

  ```typescript
  type RecurrencePattern = "none" | "daily" | "weekly";

  interface WeeklyRecurrence {
    daysOfWeek: number[]; // 0-6 representing Sunday-Saturday
  }

  interface CalendarEvent {
    id: string;
    title: string;
    startTime: string;
    endTime: string;
    category: "work" | "personal" | "meeting";
    recurrencePattern: RecurrencePattern;
    weeklyRecurrence?: WeeklyRecurrence;
  }
  ```

- The calendar uses a filtering system to display recurring events:
  - For daily events: Shows the event on all days after the start date
  - For weekly events: Shows the event only on the selected days of the week
  - For one-time events: Shows the event only on its specific date
